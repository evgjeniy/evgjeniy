### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm from Belarus, Minsk and I'm a third year student of the [BSUIR](https://www.bsuir.by/). My specialty is mainly focused on game design, but I am also interested in programming, as I want to become a skilled [Unity Developer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evgjeniy/) and I put all my efforts into it.

I am purposeful and responsible, have commercial development experience (more in the [Recommendation Letter](https://github.com/evgjeniy/evgjeniy/files/10636753/dev._signed.pdf)), learning something new pretty quickly and at the moment I already have some skills, including:
- Game Development with Unity
- C/C++, C#, Java languages
- GIT version control system
- Zenject, DOTWeen, other Unity plugins and framewors
- Advertising and marketing SDKs
- Setting up post-effects and SRP
- Optimization experience with Unity tools and patterns
- OOP and SOLID principles
- ECS architectural pattern (with LeoECS, UniLeo)
- Design Patterns
- Compliance with the required CodeStyle, writing clean and understandable code
- Dynamic Data Structures
- Algorithms (search, sort, ets.)
- Teamwork experience

I am not standing still in the field of self-development and am currently studying the construction of ECS architecture of gaming applications, and in the near future I want to study the Data Oriented Technology Stack from Unity itself.
